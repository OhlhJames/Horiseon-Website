Pulled README from Pre-Work-Study-Guide in my own repositories.
Used activity code from gitlab repository to reference proper uses of <article> <main> and <section> so that each <div> could be properly named. Also used the same git lab repository codes to look at proper spacing in lines so that the code would be easier to read and understand for the next person to come and use the code.
